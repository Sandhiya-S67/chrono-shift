This year, you got fit before getting roasted. You planted gardens and pulled pranks. You spoke up and let bots talk back. You got moody, rocked out, vibe(code)d out, and refreshed your personal portfolio. You even spent Thanksgiving drawing our world in your own style.

Now, we want to close out the year with something BIG.

We are running our first-ever Codédex Game Jam. 😱

The theme is ✨ The Changing of Time ✨.

Build anything interactive that plays with the concept of time. Metaphorically or literally. Rewind it, stretch it, wrap it, freeze it, slow it down, speed it up, or let it fall apart in interesting ways.

🕹 What You Can Build

Some ideas:

Web games built with JavaScript + Phaser
Terminal games using Python + Pygame
Native games using Lua + Love2D
Visual novels
Big and polished is cool, but we love weird little prototypes too.

🚀 How to Get Started

We will kick things off in the Codédex Discord.
